In order to compile these mex-files, you will need a fortran compiler.
Most of the testing I've done was with g95, although gfortran seems
to work as well.  In order to compile on, say, R2009b, you will
need to look at the bottom of the mexopts.R2009b.sh options file
and see if there is a stanza for your architecture and fortran
compiler.  If you don't find an exact match, take a look at other
options files.  

In any case, you need to make sure values are provided for FC, LD,
FCLIBDIR, and FLIBS, although LD should pretty much always be "g++".
FC is the location of your fortran compiler, and FCLIBDIR is the
location of fortran libraries, which will be different depending
of whether you use g95 or gfortran, and what platform you are on.
For example, on the R2007b maci platform with g95 provided by fink,
the library is /sw/lib/libg95 (yes, thats "libg95", not "libf95"),
while on R2009b maci64 with g95 provided by macports, the library
is /opt/local/lib/libf95. The compile step is as simple as typing
"make R2009b"

Tested configurations include:
	
	glnxa64 (g95):  R2007b, R2008b, R2009a, R2009b

	glnx86 (g95):  R2007b

	maci (g95):  R2007b, R2008b

	maci (gfortran):  R2007b, R2008b

	maci64 (g95): R2009b
